# test-debt

Finds **dead weight in the test suite** — the inverse of mutation testing.
Where Stryker tells you what code no test pins (surviving mutants), this reads
the same kill matrix the other way and tells you which tests pin nothing the
rest of the suite doesn't already pin.

The motivating observation: above ~90% mutation score the score stops being
informative (everyone's saturated) and the interesting number becomes *how
much suite you spend to hold it*. On zws today that's a 7.6× case-level
redundancy ratio — 106 killing tests doing the work of ~14.

## Signals

| signal | meaning | data needed |
|---|---|---|
| **gaps** | survived mutants — code no test pins | status |
| **redundancy** | tests/files whose every kill is caught elsewhere too | `killedBy` matrix |
| **theatre** | covered-but-survived — assertions ran the code but caught nothing | coverage `"all"` |

Redundancy is reported at both **file** and **case** level. Decisions should be
keyed at file level — file identity is stable across `describe` restructuring,
git tracks renames — with the case list as drill-down.

## Usage

```sh
bun run mutation             # produce reports/mutation/mutation.json
bun run test-debt            # print the signals report
bun run test-debt:decisions  # join signals against the committed decisions log
bun run test-debt:verify     # run a fresh pass + assert the matrix contract
```

### Decisions log

Signals are derived and regenerable; **decisions** about them are not, and live
in `decisions.jsonl` (committed, mergeable, append-only, last-write-wins per
file). Record one with:

```sh
bun scripts/test-debt/decisions.ts decide <test-file> <keep|prune|rewrite|investigate> "<rationale>"
```

`decisions.ts` (default `status`) joins the fresh matrix against the log and
buckets every file into **needs-review** (subsumed, no decision yet), **stale**
(the decision's basis drifted), or **settled** (decision still holds — kept off
the action list). Each decision stores a normalised content hash of the test
file *and* its subsumption snapshot at decision time; a verdict goes stale when
the file changes (real edits only — comments/formatting are normalised out) or
when the matrix around it shifts (e.g. a test elsewhere is deleted, making this
file's kills newly unique). That's what stops a `keep` from outliving its
reason.

The SQLite db (`reports/test-debt.sqlite`) is a **regenerable build artefact**
— gitignored. The tool consumes the mutation-testing-report **schema**, never a
specific runner, so the analysis is portable to any matrix-producing runner.

## How the matrix is produced (the fragile part)

Bun has no Stryker plugin and the `command` runner can't report per-test
results, so there's no kill matrix by default. We use the community
`stryker-mutator-bun-runner`, **pinned to 0.4.0 and patched** (`bun patch`,
diff committed under `patches/`). Plugin 0.4.0 predates Bun 1.3.x and was
broken against it; the patch:

1. **Emits + parses JUnit XML** (`--reporter=junit --reporter-outfile`). Bun
   1.3.x prints no per-test console lines when piped and has no TAP reporter,
   so the plugin's console-scraping parser found zero tests. JUnit is the only
   machine-readable per-test source Bun exposes.
2. **Carries `fileName`/`startPosition`** into each test result, so the report
   is keyed by real test-file paths instead of one `""` bucket — file-level
   identity.
3. **Disables the per-mutant bail** so `killedBy` lists *every* killing test,
   not just the first — without this the redundancy signal is dead.
4. **Extracts coverage from the Bun child.** The plugin's collector read
   `__stryker__` in the *runner* process, where it's always empty — the
   instrumented code runs in the Bun child. The patch dumps
   `__stryker__.mutantCoverage` from a global `afterAll` (Bun's `bun test`
   doesn't fire `process` exit events in preloads) and the adapter reads it
   back. That makes coverage `"all"` work, which is what splits gaps (NoCoverage)
   from theatre (Survived).

This rests on a pinned pair: **(Bun version, plugin+patch)**. A Bun upgrade or a
patch that stops applying can silently collapse the matrix. `verify-matrix.ts`
is the guard — run it after any bump.

`coverageAnalysis` is `"all"`: Stryker then runs only covered mutants, marking
the rest **NoCoverage** (true gaps) and leaving covered-but-undetected ones
**Survived** (theatre). That status split *is* the gap/theatre distinction —
flip coverage to `"off"` and it's lost (everything non-killed shows as
Survived). Per-mutant `coveredBy` (which *specific* tests cover a theatre mutant
— the rewrite target) still needs per-test coverage and is not yet wired; the
file/suite-level theatre signal works today.

## Caveats — the matrix nominates, a human convicts

- **Redundant ≠ useless.** Mutation operators only model the faults they model.
  A test subsumed against today's mutants can still be the only guard against a
  fault class the operators never generate, or valuable as documentation.
- **Don't minimise to 1.** A minimal cover leaves every mutant killed by exactly
  one test — no defence-in-depth. Prune toward an N-cover (every mutant killed
  ≥ N times), not the greedy minimum the ratio reports.
- The greedy "~N prunable" is an upper bound on surplus, not a delete list.
